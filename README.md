Libscientific is a C framework for multivariate and other statistical analysis
written to be quasi-completely independent of common and well-established calculus libraries,
except for the lapack library, which is used only to calculate left eigenvectors and eigenvalues.

The main goals of libscientific are:

1. To provide a simple and tiny framework for multivariate analysis that can be used not only in regular computers but also in embedded systems
2. Create a robust library of multivariate algorithms for any research and industrial application


Currently libscientific is able to compute:

  - Multivariate analysis
    - Principal Component Analysis (PCA) NIPALS algorithm) [1]
    - Partial Least Squares (PLS) NIPALS algorithm [1]
    - Consensus PCA (CPCA) NIPALS algorithm [7]
    - Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) Ordinary least squares algorithm
    - Unfold PCA (UPCA) [2]
    - Unfold PLS (UPLS) [2]
    - Fisher LDA

  - Clustering
    - K-means++ (David Arthur modification) [3]
    - Hierarchical clustering

  - Object/Instance selection
    - Most Descriptive Compounds (MDC) [4]
    - Most Dissimilar Compounds  (DIS) [5]

  - Statistical analyisis
    - R2, MSE, MAE, RMSE, BIAS, Sensitivity, Positive Predicted Values 
    - Yates analysis
    - Receiver operating characteristic (ROC)
    - Precision-Recal
    - Matrix-Matrix Euclidean, Manhattan, Cosine and Mahalanobis  distances

  - Numerical analysis
    - Estimate of an integral over a xy region (numerical integration using the trapezoid rule)
    - Natural cubic spline interpolation and prediction
    - Ordinary Least-Squares (OrdinaryLeastSquares)
    - Linear Equation Solver (SolveLSE)
    - Singular value decomposition
  
  - Optimization
     - Nelder-Mead simplex algorithm 

Moreover for some algorithms is possible to run validation methods
with parallel computing to be faster:

- Bootstrap k-fold Cross Validation (RGCV)
- Leave-One-Out
- Y-Scrambling [6]

Development
===========

If you are interested in extending or developing a new algorithm, please read here to understand the logic behind the library.

The library is engineered to have a specific data structure for every model, which is then stored in the HEAP to support dynamic memory allocation.
Every data object, such as matrix, vectors, tensors, or in general pca/pls/upca/...models, need to be manually allocated/deallocated 
using the predefined constructs  “NewSOMETHING(&…);” and “DelSOMETHING(&…);”.

For example, pca.c contains:

1. A data structure to store the model output (PCAMODEL). In this data structure, you have standard libscientific types such as matrix and vectors.
2. A function that computes the PCA model (PCA(...)). This function takes an input matrix using the libscientific data type and uses this to produce and store the pca model inside the PCAMODEL data structure.

All the multivariate analysis algorithms are implemented with this logic: reusing libscientific datatype, writing a data structure for the algorithm, and writing the necessary functions to run the calculation. 

N.B.: If you develop or modify an algorithm, a unit test and a stress test needs to be created to prove that the algorithm works and his numerically solid.


General rules for contributing
------------------------------

To contribute, you can fork the project, or if you have already forked the project
update to the latest version of libscientific, make the changes and open a Pull Request.

Here are some important requests.

Before opening a Pull Request:
  * Be sure that your code it's working.
  * No leaks. Run valgrind.
  * Comment your code with Parameters, attributes, returns, notes, and References.
  * Test examples are necessary. Tests must prove that
    - the algorithm works correctly
    - the algorithm do not present any memory leak

How to write a unit test?
-------------------------

Please first read the cmake documentation about [testing with cmake and ctest](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/book/mastering-cmake/chapter/Testing%20With%20CMake%20and%20CTest.html)

Then write a test for the proposed algorithm and save it in "src/tests" directory.
Please write a test in src/python_bindings/tests for the python binding. The test should work using pytest.

Run and submit the resulting output in the pull request specifying:
- What the algorithm does
- What the unit tests represent and what they prove.
