Description: libscientific python binding
        ============================
        
        This is a foreign function python binding of libscientific.
        
        Libscientific is a C framework  for multivariate and other statistical analysis.
        This library is capable to run:
        
        - Principal component analysis using the NIPALS algorithm
        - Partial Least Squares using the NIPALS algorithm
        - Multiple Linear Regression using the Ordinary Least Squares algorithm
        - Fisher Linear Discrimnant Analysis 
        - KMeans and Hierarchical clustering
        - Matrix/vector/tensor operations (products, matrix inversions using the Gauss-Jordan algorithm, and so on)
        - Descriptive statistics for regression and classification problems.
        - Model validation with leave-one-out and Bootstrap random kfold cross validation
        - Variable selection using genetic and metaheuristic algorithms
        - Solve linear system of equations 
        - Interpolate curves usin the natural cubic spline algorithm
